# RenameFiles

Will rename all excel files in a folder based on extensions and a specified cell contents, in this case, a date. 

This is a program used to simpify the workflow in a work related situation where we needed to rename a lot of files, based on the above rule, in order for the files nto be correctly grabbed by a VBA macro i've implemented. 

This process shaved 20-30 minutes from an agent's time and drastically improved the accuracy and limited the possible mistakes
