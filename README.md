# RenameFiles

## General use and description

Will rename all excel files in a folder based on extensions and a specified cell contents, in this case, a date.

This is a program used to simplify the workflow in a work related situation where we needed to rename a lot of files, based on the above rule, in order for the files to be correctly grabbed by a VBA macro i've implemented.

This process shaved 20-30 minutes from an agent's time and drastically improved the accuracy and limited the possible mistakes like double download, wrong name format, wrong save path, not downloading the file at all and eliminated the need to open each file individually.

## Installation process

This script can be transformed in a ```.exe``` file and used as a standalone application, via this [pyinstaller manual](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/)

## Dependencies

Requirements and dependencies will be installed via ```requirements.txt``` file: <br>
> ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Status

This application is now deprecated due to process changes, but it can be repurposed for general use in the same manner, following the same rule as above
